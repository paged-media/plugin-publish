//! IDML re-serialization — the save-back foundation (W3.B1).
//!
//! Turns a (possibly mutated) [`paged_scene::Document`] back into a
//! valid IDML package so an edited document can be saved.
//!
//! # Strategy: carry-through fidelity
//!
//! The parser keeps a *subset* of every entry's attributes; most entries
//! (fonts, preferences, tags, metadata, the XML backing store) are not
//! modeled at all. Regenerating those from the model would silently drop
//! everything the parser didn't read. So this writer does NOT regenerate
//! the package from scratch. Instead it copies the original package
//! verbatim and **patches only what the model can faithfully express**:
//!
//! * **Pass-through (byte-identical).** Every entry except the changed
//!   Spreads / Stories is copied straight out of the source ZIP with its
//!   original compressed bytes (via [`zip::write::ZipWriter::raw_copy_file`]),
//!   so `mimetype` stays first + stored and untouched entries round-trip
//!   bit-for-bit.
//! * **Patched (streaming rewrite).** `Spreads/*.xml` and `Stories/*.xml`
//!   are rewritten with a quick-xml reader→writer pass that copies the
//!   original token stream and overwrites only the attributes / text the
//!   model owns (see [`rewrite`]). Unknown attributes, child elements,
//!   `<Properties>`, processing instructions, and comments pass through
//!   untouched. When the rewrite produces bytes identical to the source
//!   (the document wasn't mutated in that entry), the entry is copied
//!   verbatim instead — so an unmutated round-trip is byte-identical
//!   across the *whole* package.
//!
//! # API shape
//!
//! [`write_idml`] takes `(&Document, original_bytes)` rather than reading
//! the source package off `Document` — even though `Document` *does*
//! retain the original entries (`Document.source`'s entries). Taking the
//! original bytes explicitly keeps the ZIP container structure (entry
//! order, compression, the stored-mimetype rule, local-header layout)
//! available for a faithful re-zip, which the decompressed entry map
//! alone can't reconstruct. No parse-side change is needed.
//!
//! # What is save-able (patch list)
//!
//! The patch surface is the intersection of (a) attributes the parser
//! round-trips onto the model and (b) the page-item / story properties
//! the mutation layer (`paged_mutate::PropertyPath`) can change. On top
//! of that property-patch foundation, W1.15 adds STRUCTURAL save-back:
//! page-item inserts / removes within a spread, new swatches / gradients
//! / styles injected into the Resources entries (see [`resources`]),
//! table-cell text + style edits, and group-member transforms. C-8 adds
//! NEW-ENTRY emission: a story minted post-parse (InsertTextFrame's
//! `parent_story`, `src: ""`) and a spread minted by `InsertPage` are
//! serialised as full parts and referenced from `designmap.xml` (see
//! [`emit`]). See [`rewrite`] for the per-element inventory and the
//! documented losses (removed PAGES still leave an orphaned entry).
